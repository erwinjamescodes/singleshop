# SingleShop Landing Page Strategy

## Page Structure & Content Strategy

### Hero Section

**Subheadline:** "Turn your product into profit in 60 seconds. No store setup, no monthly fees, just your own custom URL and instant sales."

**CTA Buttons:**

- Primary: "Start Selling Now" (Sign up)
- Secondary: "See Live Example" (Demo shop)

**Hero Visual:**

- Split screen showing phone with social media post linking to `singleshop.com/bakersue` and the resulting clean shop page

## Section 2: Problem/Solution

**Headline:** "Selling online shouldn't be this complicated"

**Problem Points:** (3-column layout with icons)

1. **"Shopify is overkill"** - "You have one product, not 1,000. Why pay $29/month for features you'll never use?"
2. **"Etsy takes forever"** - "Set up your store, wait for approval, compete with millions of sellers. Just to sell your cookies?"
3. **"Social media isn't built for sales"** - "Instagram bio links are clunky. TikTok doesn't let you sell. Twitter is just... Twitter."

**Solution:**
"SingleShop gives you one simple link to sell anything. Share it everywhere, get paid instantly."
